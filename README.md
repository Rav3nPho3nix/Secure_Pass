# Secure Pass
A simple Python passwords manager with encryption

There is 3 options:
  - See your passwords
  - Add passwords
  - Delete passwords

I RECOMMEND TO CHANGE THE ENCRYPTION METHOD TO YOUR OWN !

* 100% Safe
* Simple to use
* Easy to modify

More Informations:
* You must have the json file in the same folder than the python file
* If you have some stored passwords and then you change your encryption method, there will be an error and the password manager will crash !
